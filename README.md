# Twitch.tv Clone

React-based application that uses Open Broadcaster Software to supply a video feed, a basic Real Time Message Protocol Server to process the stream, a simple server to track which streams are broadcasting, and a user interface for viewing those streams.

Here are some challenges I anticipate running into along the way:

- Need to be able to navigate around to separate pages in the app (Hello, React-Router.)
- Need to allow a user to login/logout (Google OAuth practice, baby!)
- Need to handle forms in Redux (Did someone say Redux Forms??)
- Need to master my CRUD operations in React/Redux

See the live app <a href="https://tcs-simple-twitch-clone.netlify.app/" target="_blank" >here</a>.
